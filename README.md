# Mood Based Music Recommendation System

## Abstract
Music plays a crucial role in influencing and reflecting our moods, making mood-based music recommendation systems highly significant. By aligning music choices with the listener's current emotional state, these systems enhance the overall listening experience. Music's profound impact on emotions and mental wellbeing means that the right selection can offer comfort, motivation, or relaxation. This personalization makes music more than just entertainment; it becomes a supportive companion, adapting to and improving the listener's mood.
Furthermore, mood-based recommendations aid in discovering new music and artists, tailored to the listener's emotional context, thus broadening their musical exposure. Such systems also foster user engagement and loyalty by consistently delivering relevant and enjoyable music experiences. From a commercial perspective, this leads to increased usage and potential revenue growth for streaming services. The adaptive learning of these systems ensures that recommendations evolve with changing preferences, making them an indispensable tool in today's digital music landscape.



## Introduction and background
Problem being addressed and why itâ€™s important - 
The project addresses the challenge of enhancing the music listening experience by integrating emotional states into the recommendation process. This is significant as music is known to have a profound impact on emotions, and current recommendation systems do not adequately account for the listener's mood, potentially overlooking the deeper emotional connection that could be achieved with more personalized selections.
